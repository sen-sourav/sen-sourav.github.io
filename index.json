For my thesis project, I analyze data to search for a production process of the Higgs boson, known as the vector boson fusion (VBF) process, from the proton-proton collisions. I am also part of the analysis team looking for BSM motivated new particle decaying into top quarks. In the past, I have also worked on the design of the proposed Future Circular Hadron Collider (FCC-hh). I am also one of the analyzers in the team, measuring the most precise mass of the W boson from the Collider Detector at Fermilab proton-antiproton collision data.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://sen-sourav.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a Ph.D. student in Experimental Particle Physics at Duke University.
